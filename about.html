                    Seriously, though, I'm Odogo. I'm just an antisocial fox girl that has nothing really to do besides play video games.
                    I'm currently a junior in highschool, going into college (hopefully) for Computer Programming and minoring in Game Design.

                    I like to make things if I ever get the idea to. I've been programming since I was 10, learning Java to make Minecraft plugins using Spigot,
                    and continued doing that until I was 14 and only then did I start to touch Unity, which meant I had to learn C#.
                </div>
                <div>
                    I've touched Python, Javascript, HTML (clearly), CSS (also clearly), Java, and C#. All of which I taught myself, besides Java where I actually
                    took / actively taking classes for, but it's mostly free credits to graduate and for college as well.

                <div class="title">Goals</div>
                <div>
                    Eventually, I wanna make a game. I mean a fully fledged out game, specifically a multiplayer FPS.
                    In doing this, probably starting my own game studio along side the release of that game.
                </div>
                <div>
                    If that doesn't work out, I'd continue making minecraft plugins for the mean time and hopefully make a server that actually does half decent.
                    Currently, I'm working on it, but only time will tell if I can get it complete.

                    As of now, school is taking up most of my time. I wanna do some part-time streaming or like a once a week stream at a bare minimum.
                    I like streaming, I just never get the chance to.. do anything with it. I want to make content for YouTube and stream on Twitch,
                    but it's a lot of effort that I need to dedicate myself to, and I need to push myself for it.

                    Otherwise, I'm chilling with my homies on discord. Playing a variety of video games. I swear to god, don't ask me what my favourite is, you will
                    not get a response for it cause it changes so fucking frequently.
